This repository explores results from the Community Earth System Model ([CESM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/)), created by the National Center for Atmospheric Research ([NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/)).

The work here was done for submission as HW 07 for STAT 159/259 at UC Berkeley (Spring 2022).

This project investigates historical and future model data on temperature, humidity, and precipitation from CESM. The data collected was at the monthly resolution. Historical data spanned from 1850-2014 (inclusive) and future scenario data was from 2015-2100 (inclusive).

The future scenarios were many of those considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/)). Scenarios considered were Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP, in Watts per meter squared) 2.6 W/m2, 4.5 W/m2, 7.0 W/m2, and 8.5 W/m2.
