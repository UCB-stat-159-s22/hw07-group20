## Author Contributions
**Michael Milazzo:** Michael built the infrastructure for this project, including the environment, Makefile, Jupyter Book, Binder image, and `cesm` package. He wrote notebooks for data collection and cleaning, as well as some exploratory data analysis (EDA). Also was of significant aid in helping others to understand the earth science behind our analysis. (Michael went above and beyond for every group project this semester and should be considered for an A+ -Jake)

**Jacob Jossart:** Jake created a new branch to conduct EDA on North America. This work was saved in a notebook that became part of the Jupyter Book. Also created a utility .py within cesm and a corresponding test file. Helped write doc strings and bring main ideas together for main notebook with explanations. 

**Kaichi Inoue:** Kaichi downloaded the data and performed some local EDA. He attended all Zoom meetings and participated in discussions about the project.
