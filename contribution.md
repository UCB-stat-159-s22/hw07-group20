**Michael Milazzo:** Michael built the infrastructure for this project, including the environment, Makefile, Jupyter Book, Binder image, and `cesm` package. He wrote notebooks for data collection and cleaning, as well as some exploratory data analysis (EDA). He helped Jake write and edit the main notebook, and helped Jake and Kaichi understand the earth science behind our analysis. 

**Jacob Jossart:** Jake created a new branch to conduct EDA on North America. This work was saved in a US-specific notebook that became part of the Jupyter Book. He also created a utility .py within cesm and a corresponding test file to calculate summary statistics. Jake helped write function docstrings and bring main ideas together for main notebook with explanations. Jake wrote the main notebook, with help and editing from Michael.
